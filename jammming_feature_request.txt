OBJECTIVE
When an user press Enter key triggers a search.
BACKGROUND 
The jammming app user can find whatever artist, song or album from Spotify. For do that user should type inside the input field his/her preference. After that only when user press button Search will start the search. That make a little disturbing the User Experience UX.
The enter key is in the keyboard. If you are in your computer you should let the keyboard and take with your hand the mouse and click on search button. It will be more natural and easy if you can press Enter key that use the mouse.
TECHNICAL DESIGN

Inside SearchBar.js we need to add an extra method (pressEnter) for implement the user press Enter key. When user press Enter key will call search() method in the <input/> tag.  And it calls the new method (pressEnter).
